## 🐦 Tweet from Telegram! 💙

A afternoon-project born out of boredom. Yet, fully functional and deployable with Flask.

The code isn't totally bullet-proof, though.

## Configuration ⚙

#### Dependencies
Simply run the following command in a virtual environment:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Environment Variables

- Your Telegram bot's access token should be set as `TELEGRAM-TOKEN` environment variable.
- Your app's base url should be set as `APP_URL` environment variable.
- As well as an admin password should be set as `ADMIN_PASS` environment variable to set and delete the webhook from the Telegram bot, just in case.

Put it in a `.env` file for local development:

```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
APP_URL=<your-url-here>
ADMIN_PASS=<your-password-here>
```

#### Webhook Registration

While running first time, just hit the index of your app's url to register the webhook with Telegram.

#### Characters to be escaped in MarkdownV2
```
_  *  [  ]  (  )  ~  `  >  #  +  -  =  |  {  }  .  !
```

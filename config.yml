    Hi, {first_name}! 👋

    With me, you can now send and schedule tweets right from Telegram\! ⏳🐦

    Use the given syntaxes to see the magic\. 🔮

    *Create a single tweet*
    Send a message with the following syntax:
    
    `Tweet <enter> <enter> <your tweet>`

    *Create a thread*
    Use the above syntax and follow it with `///` to indicate the beginning of the next tweet\. You may have new lines or spaces around `///` if you like for better formatting\.

    *Scheduling Tweets*
    You can use Telegram's built\-in "Schedule Send" feature to achieve that\.

    *See if your tweets are valid beforehand \(for scheduling\)*
    Same syntax as sending out a tweet/thread, just start the message with `Scan` instead of `Tweet`\.

    *See samples*
    Send `/samples` to see sample messages/tweets to send\.

    *Authorize the Bot*
    Send `/auth` to authorize/re\-authorize the bot with your Twitter account\.

    *Verify Authorization*
    Send `/verify <space> <your code>` to complete the authorization\.

    *See your stats*
    Send `/stats` to see the number of tweets you sent with this bot\.
